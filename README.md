Order of Execution:

code.py -> out_screen -> user_choice

The Idea is to build a game where a random word is choosen by one player and
other player should guess the word.


-> All duplicates are placed according to their positions.
-> Len(word)+2 chances are given to each player
-> if the word is guessed within the chances, the player wins if not a message " Better luck next time" is shown.
